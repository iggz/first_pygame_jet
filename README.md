# First pygame 
## Jets and missles

**Functionality:**

The jet can move around freely.  The missiles are generated randomly at random speeds at a timed interval and cause a collision event with the jet.  The clouds are also generated randomly but they do not cause a collision event to happen. 

This game was put together as a learning exercise using an online tutorial found at: blog post > https://realpython.com/blog/python/pygame-a-primer/
